# Face Recognition Using OpenCV-Python

## Project Overview

This project implements face recognition functionality using OpenCV and Python. It leverages computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces from images or video streams.

## Features

1. Face Detection: Detects faces in real-time using webcam or image files.
2. Face Recognition: Recognizes and identifies faces from a database of known individuals.
3. Image Capture: Captures images of faces for storage and recognition.
4. Database Integration: Stores face data in a MySQL database.

### How to Run:-

1) First create a virtual environment using command (python3 -m venv venv)
2) after Virtual Environment gets created activate it using command (source venv/bin/activate).
3) when venv gets activated Install all the required libraries from the txt file by using command(pip install -r requirements.txt)
4) Their are multiple files which perform certain set of task.
5) To test the face recognition run main.py file which is the Main file of our Project.
